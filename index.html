            <p>To get started, you'll be working with Repl.it (pronounced as Repull it), which are simple computer programming environments that allow you to perform basic tasks. You'll use a tool called Repl.it, which exists on the web and eliminates the setup of a local environment. The Repl.it editor below allows you to execute code within the web browser, so you can jump right in.</p>
            <p><b>And what's more, you don't have to install anything on your computer.</b> </p>

            <p>Your first Repl.it challenge is below. You've totally got this. Here are a few tips on how to use Repl.it:</p>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Type <code>let me = “learning” (space) console.log(me);</code> </li>
              <li>Begin by pressing the green play button, also known as the <b>"Run ▶" </b>button, in the center of the top bar. You'll press this whenever you want to run your code to see what it's doing.</li>
              <li>Type any code and click the run button to run the code again, and you should see the green ✅. This is telling you that you got it right!</li>
            </ul>
