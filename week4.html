            <iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" height="500px" src="https://repl.it/@openclassvisa/classvisaopen?lite=true#index.html"></iframe>
            
          <h3>How to use Github to build a team website</h3>
          
          <p><b>No <i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>Take Home Assignment - The Scenario</b></p>
           <p>You are working on a team to release the Honda New Sedan 2018. New Sedan has been one of Honda's most popular vehicles for the last 20 years, and your team is under pressure to make it even better.<br><br> You are the body designer. In other words, you need to create a body design that works in tandem with the new features that the interiors team is putting in the car. Although you might have a great plan, it has to work together with all the new gadgets that the interiors team is working on.<br><br> How can you organise your workflow, so it accommodates all parties?</p>
           
         <h3>The Different Stages of Design</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>As you are developing the body for the 2018 version, there are really four versions of the design that exist at any given time.</li>
           <li>The New Sedan 2020 is out on the market and the only version the customers know about. This represents the live version.</li>
           <li>Every team contributes to the latest prototype of the 2018 sedan. This is the version that will eventually go live once all parties agree. This represents the remote repo.</li>
           <li>You have developed the latest complete version of the body that you have yet to present to the team. It takes into account suggestions you have gotten from other teams. But you still need their final approval before adding it to the latest prototype. This represents the local repo.</li>
           <li>And finally, you have an untested plan that is on your drafting paper or in a clay model. It has not even been reviewed yet to see if it meets all criteria. But you think it could be even better than all your previous designs! This is the staging area.</li>
         </ul>
         
         <p>Each stage represents a different level of commitment to the body design. Similarly, in your codebase, your code passes through four stages before it goes live. Just like in the car design process, this is a good thing! You would not want to draft up a car design, say “this looks great!” and immediately decide that it must be the final 2021 design. <br>The entire team must decide if your design works in harmony with the changes they are making. It is a democratic process!</p>

    <h2>Your Team Project Instructions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Now that you're comfortable poking around a codebase, it's time for you to write some of your own code with a team. Your first client is Classvisa Batch One. Our web developers are not available, and we need your help. Let's go!</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For your team project, you are going to be divided into groups and someone would volunteer as a team lead</li>
      <li>Each team would be assigned a simple website project and the team would choose from a list of projects to build. One of your team member would showcase your project and give an overview of your project in the next class.</li>
      <li>Let’s take the next steps, together. Schedule an Orientation video call with a member of our cofounding team this Saturday before or after your test.</li>
      <li>Once you sign up for a meeting time above, you’ll receive a calendar invite with the link to access your meeting. During the meeting, we discuss the next steps such as timeline, goals and other resources you now have at your disposal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is very important for the next phase. Let's find you a great mentor who you'll meet with once per week. Let us know the times that reliably suit your schedule.</p>

            <p>Congratulations! The Good news is you have come to the end of the first stage. The client is happy, and I'm super impressed, too. 😃</p>
            
            <h3> Pair programming</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is a well-known practice where two developers code together on a single computer towards a common goal (e.g. implement a new feature, or solve a coding challenge in this case).<br><br>
            In remote pair programming, you do the same thing, but each one of you is working from a different computer and connected to each other using a video conference. This is what you would be doing a lot in the next stage. Let us show you how this works.</p>
